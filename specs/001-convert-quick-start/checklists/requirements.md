# Specification Quality Checklist: Convert Flask UI to Next.js Application

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: October 13, 2025  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) - *Note: Next.js and React are mentioned in context of requirement, not implementation detail*
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification - *Technical dependencies listed separately, not in requirements*

## Notes

- **Resolved**: FR-018 dark mode implementation - User selected manual toggle with preference persistence (Option A)
- All checklist items now pass validation
- Spec is complete and ready for planning phase with `/speckit.plan`
- Technical dependencies section intentionally lists implementation technologies as these are constraints for the planning phase
- Open questions section provides guidance for /speckit.plan command
