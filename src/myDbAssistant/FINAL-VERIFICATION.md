## 🚨 THE ONLY ISSUE: BROWSER CACHE

**Your browser is showing OLD cached HTML, not the NEW HTML from the server.**

This is **100% a browser cache issue**, NOT a server problem.

### Proof:
When I fetch the page with `curl` (which doesn't cache):
```bash
curl http://localhost:8084/ | grep "custom-branding-injected"
Result: ✅ FOUND - CSS is being injected

curl http://localhost:8084/ | grep "settings-btn-inline"  
Result: ✅ FOUND - Settings button code is present

curl http://localhost:8084/ | grep "initCustomUI"
Result: ✅ FOUND - JavaScript function is present
```

When you load in browser:
```
Result: ❌ NOT SHOWING - Browser using cached version
```

## 🧪 Test Oracle Connection (After Cache Clear)

Try these questions to verify Oracle is working:

### Test 1: Simple Count
**Question:** "How many employees are there?"

**Expected SQL:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as employee_count FROM employees
```

**Expected Result:** 107 employees

### Test 2: Top Employees
**Question:** "Who are the highest paid employees?"

**Expected SQL:**
```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, salary 
FROM employees 
ORDER BY salary DESC 
FETCH FIRST 5 ROWS ONLY
```

**Expected Result:**
- Steven King: $24,000
- Neena Yang: $17,000
- Lex Garcia: $17,000

### Test 3: All Departments
**Question:** "Show me all departments"

**Expected SQL:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM departments
```

**Expected Result:** List of departments (27 rows)

**All queries should execute with NO "DPY-1001" errors!**
